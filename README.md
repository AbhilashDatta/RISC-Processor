# Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) Processor

This is a single cycle processor, which processes each instruction in single clock cycle, working on **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** specified in the documentation. 

## Arhitecture

## How to use it?

- Write code in given ISA in .asm file
- Convert that code into binary instructions using formatting given in documentation
- Store instructions in .coe file
- Load .coe file in Instruction Memory
- Simulate the test bench of RISC processor

## Requirements

- Xilinx ISE 14.7 (To run the code)
